## How to use
FTP into your PlayStation 5 and delete, rename or backup the `cheats` folder from `/data/etaHEN/` and replace it with the `cheats` folder from my collection.

`IMPORTANT!` Restart and re-jb the PlayStation. Enjoy your brand new cheats.

## Find compatible cheats
[**CLICK HERE**](https://raw.githack.com/TeeKay87/HEN-Cheats-Collection/master/list/index.html) to open the [**CHEATSLIST PAGE**](https://raw.githack.com/TeeKay87/HEN-Cheats-Collection/master/list/index.html) and search for either an `ID` or `game title` to find what version of the game has a compatible cheat file and see a list of all available cheats.

## Version History
### 2026-02-17
Added lots of new cheats.
Added new cheat sources.

Major rework of my HEN Cheats Manager to make it able to merge cheatfiles belonging to same ID/Version combo into a single file. This change will make more cheats available for games that have multiple files from multiple creators as etaHEN only can use one cheat of each file format at a time.

### 2026-02-11
`[ADDED]`	PPSA01390	01.000.000	Dragon Age™: The Veilguard Deluxe Edition

### 2026-02-05
`[ADDED]`	PPSA02525	01.009.000	Tormented Souls

Collection created with new version of my HEN Cheats Manager.

Added `Yharnam` cheats.

Some of the official cheats, and cheats from other sources, are missing tags in their json and xml formatting, and some have other issues. HEN-CM now tries to repair these broken files to hopefully make more cheats work as intended.

As of 2026-02-17, my collection has support for `2359` games and updates, whereas the official etaHEN Cheats repository has cheats for `2130`.

### 2026-01-31
Added the first iteration of the collection containing cheats for 2284 different games and versions

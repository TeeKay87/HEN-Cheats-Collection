## Notes
### 2026-02-17
Added lots of new cheats.
Added new cheat sources.

Major rework of my HEN Cheats Manager to make it able to merge cheatfiles belonging to same ID/Version combo into a single file. This change will make more cheats available for games that have multiple files from multiple creators as etaHEN only can use one cheat of each file format at a time.

### 2026-02-05
Collection created with new version of my HEN Cheats Manager.

Added `Yharnam` cheats.

Some of the official cheats, and cheats from other sources, are missing tags in their json and xml formatting, and some have other issues. HEN-CM now tries to repair these broken files to hopefully make more cheats work as intended.

As of 2026-02-26, my collection has support for `2364` games and updates, whereas the official etaHEN Cheats repository has cheats for `2130`.

### 2026-01-31
Added the first iteration of the collection containing cheats for 2284 different games and versions

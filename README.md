## How to use
FTP into your PlayStation 5 and delete, rename or backup the `cheats` folder from `/data/etaHEN/` and replace it with the `cheats` folder from my collection.

`IMPORTANT!` **Restart and re-jb the PlayStation. Enjoy your brand new cheats**.

## Find compatible cheats
Go [**HERE TO OPEN THE CHEATS PAGE**](https://raw.githack.com/TeeKay87/HEN-Cheats-Collection/master/list/index.html) where you can find all available cheats. Search for either an `ID`, `title` or `cheat creator` to to filter the list.

Play your way.

Added lots of new cheats.
Added new cheat sources.

Major rework of my HEN Cheats Manager to make it able to merge cheatfiles belonging to same ID/Version combo into a single file. This change will make more cheats available for games that have multiple files from multiple creators as etaHEN only can use one cheat of each file format at a time.

### 2026-02-11
`[ADDED]`	PPSA01390	01.000.000	Dragon Age™: The Veilguard Deluxe Edition

### 2026-02-05
`[ADDED]`	PPSA02525	01.009.000	Tormented Souls

Collection created with new version of my HEN Cheats Manager.

Added `Yharnam` cheats.

Some of the official cheats, and cheats from other sources, are missing tags in their json and xml formatting, and some have other issues. HEN-CM now tries to repair these broken files to hopefully make more cheats work as intended.

As of 2026-02-17, my collection has support for `2359` games and updates, whereas the official etaHEN Cheats repository has cheats for `2130`.

### 2026-01-31
Added the first iteration of the collection containing cheats for 2284 different games and versions
